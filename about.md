## WTF is WWWTF?
WhatTheFest is the series of events formerly known as JSFest!
With so many events surrounding web technologies it was about time we dropped the “JS”,
in favour of a name that was more inclusive to the spectrum of topics being covered.

Originally intended to be WWWTechFest, WhatTheFest sort of stuck ;)

## WWWho can join?
Any events happening in April/May 2017 around web development and technologies
are free to register their event. It could be networking, hacking, a conference,
or a meetup! This site is merely a way to aggregate all the events, but you will
need to follow the respective links on the event to register/find out more.

## HoWWW can I contribute?
This site is created with love by members of the Berlin web technologies community.
You want to contribute your own event? <a href="/add-your-event">Add it here</a>. We also
welcome pull requests and any suggestions for improvements :)
