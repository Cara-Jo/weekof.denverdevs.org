Everyone can add events to our schedule. Yes, you can, too. Even your company. We will promote your event, just as we promote all the others.

We welcome workshops, social events, charitable activities, hackathons, doc sprints, open office hours or tours, meetups, job fairs, flash mobsâ€¦ if you think web developers and their friends would enjoy it, pitch it.

## How to get your event on the list

You can [submit a pull request](https://github.com/Denver-Devs/weekof.denverdevs.org).

Remember to provide all important details, including the **date** and **times**, **location**, and a **link** to your event website.

We will merge your pull request as soon as possible, or ping you if we have any questions.

Thank you for helping to make WeekOf Denver Devs more awesome.
